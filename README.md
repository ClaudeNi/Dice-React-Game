# Dice-React-Game
A weekend project where I created a small dice game using React.

# Project Link
[Dice App](https://claudeni-dice.netlify.app/)

## Info
In this project we used the React library to build our very own dice game.  

## site
As shown in the opening page, to play the game you just roll and collect points up to the goal.

You can only play after locking in your goal, if nothing is inserted then it defaults to 100 points.

As you roll dice and collect points, you get to see how many points you roll in a turn and how many points you have overall.

Eventually someone will reach the goal and be declared the winner of the game.

You can easily start a new game or even restart your current game at any time by pressing the new game button.
